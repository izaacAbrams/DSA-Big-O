1. 1) O(1)
   2) O(log n)
2. O(1) because it is accessing value and determining if the value is even.
3. O(n ^ k) There are two levels of loops before it returns a value.
4. O(n) because it is looping over each item in array and doubling it
5. O(n) loops throught the array and finds the item that is the same as input item
6. O(n^k) because there are two levels of loops before it combines the items in a console log
7. O(n) the algo creaes a fibonacci sequence. 
8. O(log n) because it takes the array, loops over it and returns the index
9. O
